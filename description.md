# Secure Your Software Supply Chain with Chainguard

Learn how to dramatically reduce vulnerabilities in your container images and dependencies using Chainguard's zero-CVE platform. This hands-on lab demonstrates real-world security improvements you can implement immediately in your development workflow.

Traditional container images often ship with hundreds of known vulnerabilities, creating significant security risks and compliance burdens. In this lab, you'll discover how Chainguard's minimal, hardened images and secure dependency management can eliminate these vulnerabilities without changing your application code.

## What You'll Learn

- **Identify vulnerability exposure**: Scan traditional container images and understand attack surface risks
- **Switch to zero-CVE images**: Replace standard base images with Chainguard's minimal alternatives
- **Secure language dependencies**: Configure package managers to use Chainguard's signed, verified libraries
- **Generate compliance artifacts**: Create SBOMs, verify signatures, and validate attestations for audit readiness

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Docker and container concepts
- Understanding of package managers (npm for Node.js)
- No prior Chainguard experience required

## Duration

Approximately 30 minutes

## What Makes This Lab Unique

You'll see a dramatic before-and-after comparison: start with a Node.js application built on a standard image containing hundreds of CVEs, then transform it into a secure, compliant application with zero known vulnerabilities—all with minimal code changes.
